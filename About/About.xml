	<description><![CDATA[Adds a Wall Mountable Shield and Wall Mounted AA Turret to the game, requires my other mod Wall Stuff to work.
		Wall Shield - Wall mounted shield that produces a square/rectangular barrier that destroys any enemy bullets or mortar shells that hit.
		AA Turret - Turret that only targets inbound Drop Pods, Ship Chunks, Defoliator Ships and Psychic Drone Ships

		Configurable Mod Settings:
		Wall Shield power usage (scales with the size defended)
		AA Turret range, reload speed and ammo count (i.e. how many targets can be destroyed before it needs to reload)
