[h2]Rimworld Wall Defenses V2[/h2]
This mod adds multiple wall mounted items used for defending your colony and is basically an updated version of my original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2401320640]Wall Defenses[/url] mod, YOU CANNOT REPLACE THE ORIGINAL MOD WITH THIS ONE IN THE MIDDLE OF A SAVE !!! (That's why this is a separate mod entirely)

[h2]Changes from the original (Skip if you never used it)[/h2]
[list]
[*]Uses Rimworlds built in wall mounting mechanism where possible (Hence why this isn't save compatible)
[*]Wall Shield now only has the area shielding mechanism no longer has the rectangle one
[*]AA Turret no longer needs to be un-roofed
[*]No custom research requirements
[*]Slightly (lol) better graphics
[*]Removed Wall Stuff dependency 

[h3]Features[/h3]
[list]
[*]AA Turret - Wall/Roof mounted and can shoot down incoming DropPods etc. - All parameters for how much damage is done to drop pods, chance of destroying them is configurable in the settings.
[*]Laser Grid - Wall mounted can automatically (when enemies present) or manually create a wall that pawns can't get through, can still be destroyed if the emitter/reflector are attacked and can always be shot through, power usage is fully configurable.
[*]Wall Shield - Wall mounted shield unit, select an Area defined in game and have it automatically shielded when enemies are on the map, fully configurable to either just be an energy drain, a drain on batteries when it blocks shots and if you want it to overload when batteries drained (With a large EMP explosion when failure occurs) won't block enemy lasers at this time, colour of the shield can be chosen.
[*](Requires Odyssey and/or Biotech) Hull/Wall Turret - Wall replacement turrets, works and connects to existing walls/hulls (including diagonals for Gravship Hulls), fires a beam similar to Tesseron beam, cannot fire over walls but uses no ammo (Drains from batteries instead) damage and battery drain values are configurable in mod settings.

[h3]Mod Compatibility[/h3]
Almost certainly isn't CE compatible and won't ever be sorry !

[h3]Known Issues[/h3]
[list]
[*]None yet !
[/list]


[h2]The Point Of This Mod[/h2]
Wall Defenses needed to be updated to use the "new" Rimworld mounting system for wall objects but it was going to be too big of a breaking change, this also let me remove some stuff like research that's no longer required etc.

[h2]Future Plans[/h2]
[list]
[*]Try and get the shield to also block lasers
